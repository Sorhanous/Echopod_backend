# 1. SET UP -------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you install dependencies in requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Google has black listed all DO servers and hence we need to use residentail proxies.
# I have paid for smartproxy.com and hard coded the proxy list in main.py. youtube transcripts otherwise won't return. 
# keep this in mind if it fails again, you might need to change proxies 

To intstall dependencies make sure you use a virtual env 1st: 

Root folder: 
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
 Make sure you install dependencies in requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# After working on your project:
`deactivate`


# 2.RUN -----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run, In database.py you can set the env to:

- development (local postgres db): e1
- production (RDS): e2 

then run the `main.py` script. 


# 3. DEPLOY ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: we are using Gunicorn and Nginx for Production. SSL is also set up (90 days expiration)

# Connect to your EC2 instance and navigate to your project directory
`ssh -i "/Users/sorhan/Documents/Secret/Bevi_Linux_Host.pem" ubuntu@54.245.23.78`

# Pull the latest changes from the repository
`git pull origin main`

# make sure you have tested the app and there are no errors and set the env = e2

# Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies (if needed)
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Restart Gunicorn to apply changes
`sudo systemctl restart gunicorn`
`sudo systemctl status gunicorn`

# Restart Nginx (optional)
`sudo systemctl restart nginx`
`sudo systemctl status nginx`

# Check the logs for any errors
`sudo journalctl -u gunicorn -r`
`sudo journalctl -u nginx -r`
